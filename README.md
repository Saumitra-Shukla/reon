TODO list for REON
================

* Manager 
* Update and lauch mechanics. Remember we are changing the standard openpilt code out with the REON one. This means we can install packages in lauch_openpilot.sh and check if they are on the newest possible version. 
* Messeging: We have to choose something like ZMQ or Scons
